# MADI

This repository contains a Python implementation of MADI.

Two major modules are included:

- leiden clustering module.

- DE feature analysis module.



## Prerequisite

python 3.6

python packages: scanpy, pandas, numpy


## Major module function

### leiden clustering module
The Leiden algorithm automatically performs spatially agnostic clustering and optimizes cluster approximation based on similarities in molecular features.

### DE feature analysis module
Wilcoxon Rank Sum test was used to highlight the most changed complex carbohydrates within each cluster.


## Dataset description
Matrix features in the experiments are provided.

## Usage instruction
Please modify the path to use the modules.
